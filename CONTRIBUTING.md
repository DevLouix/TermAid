# Contributing to TermAid

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TermAid! This guide will help you add new commands and improve the project.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Adding New Commands

Commands are stored in JSON files under the `commands/` directory, organized by category.

#### Step 1: Choose the Right Category

```
commands/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file_operations/     # File and directory commands
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system_info/         # System information commands
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ network/             # Network-related commands
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process_management/  # Process and service management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ text_processing/     # Text manipulation commands
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ permissions/         # Permission and user management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package_management/  # Package managers (apt, yum, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/             # Compression and archiving
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ disk_management/     # Disk and filesystem commands
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ search/              # File search commands
```

If your command doesn't fit any category, create a new one!

#### Step 2: JSON Format

Each command entry should follow this format:

```json
{
  "command_name": [
    {
      "response": "command <arg1> <arg2>",
      "explanation": "Clear, concise explanation of what the command does",
      "example": "command example value"
    },
    {
      "response": "command -flag <arg>",
      "explanation": "Explanation of this variant",
      "example": "command -flag example"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fields:**
- `response` (required): The command syntax with placeholders in `<angle brackets>`
- `explanation` (required): What the command does (be clear and helpful!)
- `example` (optional but recommended): A real-world example

#### Step 3: Example - Adding a New Command

Let's add the `tree` command to `commands/file_operations/basic.json`:

```json
{
  "tree": [
    {
      "response": "tree",
      "explanation": "Display directory structure in tree format"
    },
    {
      "response": "tree -L <depth>",
      "explanation": "Limit tree depth to specified number of levels",
      "example": "tree -L 2"
    },
    {
      "response": "tree -a",
      "explanation": "Show hidden files in tree",
      "example": "tree -a"
    },
    {
      "response": "tree -d",
      "explanation": "Show directories only",
      "example": "tree -d"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Step 4: Test Your Addition

```bash
# Test search
./termaid.py search tree

# Test explanation
./termaid.py explain "tree -L 2"

# Verify it appears in the list
./termaid.py list | grep tree
```

### 2. Improving Existing Commands

You can enhance existing commands by:

1. **Adding more examples**
   ```json
   {
     "response": "grep <pattern> <file>",
     "explanation": "Search for pattern in file",
     "example": "grep 'error' logfile.txt"
   }
   ```

2. **Clarifying explanations**
   - Make them more beginner-friendly
   - Add warnings for dangerous commands
   - Include common use cases

3. **Adding common flags and options**
   - Include frequently used variations
   - Document important options

### 3. Code Contributions

#### Areas for Improvement

1. **Command Parsing**
   - Better argument detection
   - Support for piped commands
   - Handle complex command chains

2. **Matching Algorithm**
   - Improve fuzzy matching
   - Better flag detection
   - Context-aware suggestions

3. **Features**
   - Command aliases support
   - Interactive tutorial mode
   - Command recommendations
   - Shell integration improvements

4. **Documentation**
   - More examples
   - Video tutorials
   - Translations

#### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TermAid.git
cd TermAid

# Create a branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and test
./termaid.py list
./termaid.py search your_command

# Commit with clear messages
git commit -m "Add: tree command with examples"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Writing Good Explanations

#### Do's ‚úÖ
- Be clear and concise
- Use simple language
- Include practical examples
- Mention important flags
- Warn about dangerous operations
- Explain what the command achieves, not just what it does

#### Don'ts ‚ùå
- Don't use jargon without explanation
- Don't make assumptions about user knowledge
- Don't write overly technical explanations
- Don't forget examples for complex commands

#### Examples

**Good:**
```json
{
  "response": "rm -rf <directory>",
  "explanation": "Force remove directory recursively (use with caution! This permanently deletes everything)",
  "example": "rm -rf old_folder"
}
```

**Bad:**
```json
{
  "response": "rm -rf <directory>",
  "explanation": "Removes directory",
  "example": "rm -rf /"
}
```
